    title: The Bear Comes Home
    description: Winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. The hero of this sensational first novel is an alto-sax virtuoso trying to evolve a personal style out of Coltrane and Rollins. He also happens to be a walking, talking, Blake- and Shakespeare-quoting bear whose musical, spiritual, and romantic adventures add up to perhaps the best novel, ursine or human, ever written about jazz.
    review1: A hilarious, richly imagined bear's eye view of love, music, alienation, manhood and humanity . . . that recalls Pynchon at his most controlled.
    reviewer1: Publishers Weekly
    review2: The Bear Comes Home is a book that cuts straight to the heart of things. By turns wry and whimsical, by turns brave, sad and questing, it's as profoundly affecting as a great jazz solo and, like a great solo, lingers in the mind afterward.
    reviewer2: The Washington Post
    review3: In fluent, witty prose Zabor conveys with remarkable vividness the texture of group improvisation.... It swings
    reviewer3: New York Newsday

    title: I, Wabenzi
    description: Straight from the unchartered territory between Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Tristram Shandy, I, Wabenzi lifts a corner of the known world as if it were the edge of a curtain, and begins to show a reality new to our literature gleaming on the other side.
